3 points and at least 1 paragraph per point

-confidence through prising the process not the results/talent 
-growth mindset: the belief that intelligence can be developed. That success comes from; effort, practice and hard work
-fixed mindset: “I just have a certain amount and that’s it”
-Fixed and growth mindsets are attitudes towards learning and beliefs about the roots of success.
-Fixed mindset attaches labels which can be damaging 
-Effort and process vs output and achievement)
###Point 2: Describe which aspects of each mindset I recognize in myself
talk about labels vs how much easier it is to develop confidence through praising practice
