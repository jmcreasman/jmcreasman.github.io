##What's in an Office?
First off congrats to everyone for making it through / surviving week 4! I’m sure that’s as hard as it’s going to get. Anyways, last week I (along with the rest of the cohort) got to tour the offices of our next door neighbor Bronto. I’m not sure if I would want to work there but I’d love to work in an office like theirs. This got me thinking about the kind of office I’d like to work in and the kind I’d rather avoid. After graduating college I soon got a job working at a call center which was a really bad experience (another story for another day though) but one of the reasons why I disliked working there was their office layout. It was the conventional cubicle style that is thankfully fading away. I found working there to be claustrophobic and it just made an already miserable job even more so. So much so that while looking for a new job I would avoid places that had that style of office space.

Thankfully my next employer had their office at the American Underground. What I liked about working out of there was that they gave you the freedom to work in an environment that best  suited any given mood you might have for that work day. Want to work in a more secluded spot? Check. Want to work in an open spaced area? Check. Outside? Check. They even had the more cubicle style areas too should you prefer that. I often found myself working in many different spots throughout the day because I dislike working in the same location for hours on end (like most people I’d assume). For me, the day doesn’t seem to drag when the environment around me changes. This is why I really liked Bronto’s offices as they seemed to mimic the same vibe the American Underground had going for it. I’m not sure where I’ll end up job wise but I sure hope they’ll continue this ever growing trend of “choose your own workspace”.
