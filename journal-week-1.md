In my first week here at The Iron Yard aside from getting use to the “emersion” way of learning the areas I had the most difficulty with learning how to use git command lines to push our work to github and how to set up mocha chai for our npm testing. Thankfully with the help of my fellow students and instructors I was able to create two checklists that made doing this a breeze.

*Git commands for pushing to github*
* git status
* git add filename (to stage it)
* git status (I like to do this to confirm that the right things have been staged)
* git commit -m ‘comment goes here’
* git push
* then just type in your login info and you’re done :D

_Installing package.json_
* npm init
* name it (all lower case and I suggest naming it after branch)
* version (0.0.0)
* skip description
* entry point (go with default it doesn’t matter)
* test command (put mocha here)
* skip git repository and keywords
* type yes
