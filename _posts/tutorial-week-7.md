##HTML Basics - The <button> Tag
Buttons are very extroverted personalities on your page and they love having visitors click on them. Just like the `<a>` tags from last week if you don’t include any `<button>` tags on your site, it’ll be sad and we don’t want that.

###Step 1. The return of the angle brackets
If you’re a frequent subscriber to HTML Basics than you’ll know about the importance of angle brackets. HTML is pretty much useless without them. When you’ve properly dressed up your button it should look like this…. `<button></button>`. Remember don’t forget the closing `/`.

###Step 2. Style that sucker
The `<button>` tag comes with several attributes to help you style and customise your button to suit your needs. Here’s some to help get you started.
autofocus - Specifies that a button should automatically get focus when the page loads
formaction - Specifies where to send the form-data when a form is submitted.
type - Specifies the type of button
button 
The button is a clickable button
submit
The button is a submit button (submits form-data)
reset
The button is a reset button (resets the form-data to its initial values)

###Step 3. Name it!
Your button won’t feel very special if it doesn’t have a name so make sure to give it one like this `<button>I Matter</button>`
