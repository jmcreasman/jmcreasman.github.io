HTML Basics - The `<a>` Tag
Without `<a>` tags your page won’t be able to interact with other pages and that’s sad. Don’t make your page sad.

Step 1. All about those angle brackets
Make sure you start with opening `<` and closing `>`  angle brackets. Your `<a>` tag will feel naked without them. Also don’t forget the `/`!
Example: `<a></a>`

Step 2. Link it up!
Your `<a>` tag won’t know where to go unless you tell it to! 
Example:
`<a href=”http://www.google.com”></a>`

Step 3. Add some attributes
There are many to choose from. Here’s some examples:
download - Specifies that the target will be downloaded when a user clicks on the hyperlink
hreflang - Specifies the language of the linked document
rel - Specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document
type - Specifies the media type of the linked document

Step 4. Don’t forgot some text
This will be the text that the link is added too
Example:
`<a href=”http://www.google.com”>Google it!</a>`
