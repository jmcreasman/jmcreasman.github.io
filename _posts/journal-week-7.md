Last week we finally got to work in teams all working on the same group project from the same GitHub repository. Absolutely nothing went wrong and everyone communicated expertly. No branches were merged too early, everyone knew whose code was whose, and we all got along with each other. In all honestly, despite the challenges we had to overcome I much enjoyed that week’s homework assignment. Every day amongst our groups we switched who was team leader for that group. The team leader couldn’t code but had to organise everyone and guide them through their work. I found out that I enjoyed being team leader much more than I thought I would and that I was pretty good at organising people and helping them stay on task. Finally, when I wasn’t team leader I learned that the best team leaders are the ones that buy their group pizza.
