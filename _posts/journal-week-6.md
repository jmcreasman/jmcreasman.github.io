This last weekend was probably the most fun I’ve had working on the homework because here at the halfway point we’re finally pulling together everything we’ve been learning into one project. In this case, combining our knowledge of html, css and javascript to create a blog template based off of one from themeforest. It was nice too that (aside from the blueprints) this was the only major project in the assignment so we had the time to invest in making it the best it could be instead of just enough to pass. I had a lot of ups and downs in this project but overall feel like I got a much greater grasp on how css works and positioning, plus I was able to write the whole thing in sass so I have that down pat now. Some of the downs though include; sinking too much time into trying to make a featured image slider that almost worked but had to be dropped due to time and some other minor features. Overall I was very pleased with what the final product turned out to be.
