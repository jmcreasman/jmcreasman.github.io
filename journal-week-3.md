##My Love Hate/Affair with CSS

After two weeks of having JavaScript smash my poor brain into mush I heard seven little words the made my day.

“This week we’ll be focusing on CSS”.

“THANK GOD!” - I thought to myself - “I know CSS, I’ve used it before. Heck I’ve taken the codecademy course, how hard can this be right?” Let’s pause for a moment of silence for my poor, poor misguided past self. Because as I would soon find out there is a BIG difference between using CSS to change a color here and there and using CSS extensively to create and position a whole page.

It only took the second day for me to begin to realize this as I was bombarded with new words like static, margin and inline blocking. Words for which I just could not understand the concept of (for whatever reason). This got very frustrating very fast as I felt that the sheer amount of homework was preventing me from having the time to experiment and understand how these properties and values came together to make a webpage “pop!”. Thankfully the weekend was just around the corner.

By the time the weekend came around I had decided that I was going to spend as much of it as it took, not on the homework, but on researching and understanding the subject matter. (For more on this see my tutorial essay on how to homework successfully). So I started from square one on my Blueprint projects and began working on one, seeing how different properties/values affected the page. If I encountered one I did not understand I would research it until I did. Slowly but surely I began to grasp the concept. Not only was I able to complete the one project I started on, but I ended up completing all of them. Now, instead of hating CSS I love it! And I’m sure from here on out CSS is always going to be a breeze……..right?
