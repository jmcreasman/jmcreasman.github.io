To be honest I have a difficult time coming up with topics for tutorial based journal entries but this one popped into my head so I figured I’d roll with it. Right now this is mostly just a stream of thoughts that I’ll flesh out over the week so bear with me if it doesn't make as much sense at first.

How to make the most out of your weekend:
With time management being a big issue with people trying to complete their homework on time the weekend can be a big sigh of relief. So I figured I’d share how I break down my weekend to make the most of my time.
##Thursday:
After homework review like every day I scan through the entire assignment at least twice to see how everything is connected and to get the “lay of the land”. I then get all of my yak shaving and journal entry/cheat sheet tasks knocked out. Then I spend the rest of the time until 5pm researching what topics I think I’ll need to know for the weekend’s homework. But once 5 hits I go home and spend the rest of my evening as downtime (doing whatever I find relaxing). I feel like this is an important step as it helps clear my head of all the stress built up over the weekend. And in a program as work intensive as ours it’s vital to find even just a small bit of time to do this. For me that’s Thursday night.
##Friday:
This day is spent mostly just researching the topics I’ll need to know as well as catch up on topics I’m still a dim bulb on. I also make out an outline of what order I’ll be tackling the assignments and how much time I think I’ll need to give to them. Sometime about Friday afternoon/evening I’ll start on the homework and make sure I’ve at least touched on everything. While I don’t give myself as much freetime on this day I do try and give myself an hour or two at night to relax.
##Saturday:
This is where the bulk of my work load gets completed. About 8 or 9 in the morning I’ll go to a local starbucks and start working. If I’ve done my research and outline well then I don’t have too much trouble working through everything. About 2 or 3 in the afternoon I take about an hour break and try to head to a park to walk around and clear my head. Then it’s back to work! The only other break I take is for dinner (need that fuel). By this point about 75/80% of my homework is done.
##Sunday:
On Sundays I cheat and let myself sleep in. Usually starting work after lunch. By this point I work until the homework is completed and this always varies week to week. Sometime I finish early in the day and try to use that time to look ahead and see what topics will be covered in the coming week.

I hope this helps anyone who might be trying to rework their weekend workflow. I find that the small portion of time I take out for relaxation really helps me focus and stay sharp. Feel free to adopt/adapt this for your weekend. Keep on swimming!
