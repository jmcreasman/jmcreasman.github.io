Week two for me got off to a rough start. I was still getting use to the learning style that the Iron Yard employs and that led to a couple half completed homework assignments. I was getting frustrated with what felt like an impossible challenge of self teaching. That all changed during the weekend while working on the homework. I had decided that instead of completing the assignment I would focus on digging in and teaching myself the concept we were working on (in this case it was the DOM). Lo and behold by spending the first half of my weekend simply studying I actually was able to complete all of the assignment plus the Beast Mode sections.
This weekend was really a turning point for me as I got to experience how this immersion teaching style is effective. That I am not going to understand 100% of what is taught right away, but to persevere knowing that it comes in time. I also really enjoyed the weekendâ€™s assignment as I got to see how everything we had been learning would come together as a Front End Developer. By putting together the css, html and javascript to create web pages I knew that this was a career I wanted to pursue.
