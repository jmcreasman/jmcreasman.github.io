Week two for me got off to a rough start. I was still getting use to the learning style that the Iron Yard employs and that led to a couple half completed homework assignments. I was getting frustrated with what felt like an impossible challenge of self teaching. That all changed during the weekend while working on the homework. I had decided that instead of completing the assignment I would focus on digging in and teaching myself the concept we were working on (in this case it was the DOM). Lo and behold by spending the first half of my weekend simply studying I actually was able to complete all of the assignment plus the Beast Mode sections.

This weekend was really a turning point for me as I got to experience how this immersion teaching style is effective. That I am not going to understand 100% of what is taught right away, but to persevere knowing that it comes in time. I also really enjoyed the weekend’s assignment as I got to see how everything we had been learning would come together as a Front End Developer. By putting together the css, html and javascript to create web pages I knew that this was a career I wanted to pursue.

I have also already began thinking about what kind of job I’d like to have in the future after I graduate from the Iron Yard. I come from a marketing background and my previous job before coming here was at a small marketing agency doing web design. I LOVED what I did there but could not really take my job any further because of my lack of knowledge in coding. That was a big reason why I came to study here. I would like to go back to a marketing agency and apply what I learn here along with my knowledge of photoshop and copy writing to create/design websites.
