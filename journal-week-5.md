##Do You Even Logic?
During my interview process here I had my one on one interview with Kelly. Near the end she asked me a question that I was not expecting. It was a logic based puzzle and I don’t exactly remember what the question was or what answer I gave (other than that is was way more complicated than it needed to be). What I do remember was distinctly wondering why logic would be important or relevant in programing. If six weeks into the Iron Yard has taught me anything it is that logical thinking is a VERY important skill to have. Concepts like being able to break large problems down into smaller ones, recognizing patterns and even writing pseudo code all require some form of logical thought process. Homework assignments like the chess set have taught me how all of these concepts work together in a programmer's mind to produce working code. Its also taught me that developing this skill can only come with time and practice. There is no cheat sheet or “ten easy steps” for becoming a better thinker. Just lots and lots of hard work. Now that we are nearing the second half of the program this is the one area I most want to see myself grow in.
